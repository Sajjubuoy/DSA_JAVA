 My DSA Journey in Java

Welcome to my personal repository where I share my complete Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey using Java. This includes all my DSA code implementations, problem-solving attempts, and handwritten notes for quick revision.



 What's Inside

 Code Implementations
- Java programs covering important DSA topics
- Clean and beginner-friendly code
- Each topic organized in separate folders

 Handwritten Notes
- PDF notes summarizing each concept
- Easy-to-understand explanations
- Useful for quick revisions



 How I Practice
- Solving problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio
- Writing optimized and readable Java code
- Revisiting tough problems and maintaining topic-wise notes



 Why This Repository?
This repository helps me:
- Stay consistent in my DSA journey
- Prepare for coding interviews and placements
- Keep everything organized in one place for revision
